# BSEC_mpy


BSEC library for micropython

I highly doubt that the license agreement that i claimed to have read before downloading the software lets me distribute it, so i won't include it here.

link to download it for yourself: https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/software-tools/software/bsec/

extract and move `algo/normal_version/bin/armcc/Cortex_M4F/libalgobsec.lib` to here. then run something.py
